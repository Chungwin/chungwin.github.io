title: How to build a Recruiting Dashboard
---

This is a post from a presentation I gave in an internal all-hands session at Jimdo early June 2021. The presented project started as a small personal side project. And the main purpose was to give myself an excuse to learn NodeJS and improve my programming skills. Fast forward a couple of months later we use this app in recruitment meetings to gain deeper insights and I’m collaborating with the Data Department to make this Dashboard accessible for the whole organization. 

In this article I want to share some insights and learnings about the process of building the dashboard. In the second, more technical part of this article, I focus on the engineering part (and not on the process of visualizing the data with Tableau) because in my case, accessing the required data in the first place was the main barrier to overcome to realise my ideas. In this post I want to make this seemingly “technical” data topic more accessible for people with a non-technical background. And by doing that I want to encourage non-technical professionals to explore deeper the route of “data-driven” (if this is a domain of interest for you). In the end, it requires less technical understanding than one might think to become a "data expert" in a given domain.
